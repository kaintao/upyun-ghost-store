# Ghost Upyun Storage
将图片储存于又拍云。

已通过 0.10.0 测试

**主要基于原作者，修改了存储路径，原路径，如果图片名称相同，并且在1个月内，就会被覆盖掉，所以调整了图片存储路径规则**

**1.1.0 以前的版本在 0.10.0 将无法使用，请您及时升级到新版**  
**1.1.0 不支持直接通过模块启动，请您修改 index.js 中的 BaseStore 到对应的地址**  
**1.0.1 有 BUG，不影响正常使用，但不推荐使用**  

## 安装
* 在 `content` 文件夹中创建一个名为 `storage` 的文件夹
* 将本仓库克隆至 `storage` 文件夹下

   ```
   cd path/to/your/ghost/content/storage
   git clone https://github.com/sanddudu/upyun-ghost-store.git
   ```

  或者 [下载 zip 包](https://github.com/sanddudu/upyun-ghost-store/archive/master.zip) 后解压至 storage 文件夹下（请将解压出的文件夹名改名为 `upyun-ghost-store`）
* 安装依赖包

   ```
   cd upyun-ghost-store
   npm install
   ```

## 配置
在 `upyun-ghost-store` 文件夹下自带已经修改好的 `config.example.js`（无备注），您只需要复制到主目录后修改相应内容，并改名为 `config.js` ，您也可以自行根据以下默认配置自行添加（请不要忘记根据实际情况在末尾添加逗号）。

```
storage: {
  active: 'upyun-ghost-store',
  'upyun-ghost-store': {
    bucket: 'my-bucket', //bucket 名称
    operator: 'somebody', //操作员用户名
    password: 'secret', //操作员密码
    domain: 'http://bucket.b0.upaiyun.com', //空间绑定的域名，必须带 "http(s)://" ，结尾不能有 "/"
    filePath: 'YYYY/MM/', //文件远端保存地址，默认为日期格式，由 moment 解析后填充，
                            您可以修改为 "[您的目录地址]"，开头不能加 "/"，结尾必须加 "/"
                            具体格式参见： [http://momentjs.com/](http://momentjs.com/)
    imgVersion: '' // 自定义版本，需带上分隔符（如 _large ）。使用原图则留空或删除该选项
  }
}
```
